Homework Challenge 22

*Write a program that will convert a Reverse Polish Notation expression for simple arithmetic (add, subract, multiply, divide) into an equivalent expression using infix notation.*


### My notes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation

### My environment
```
mrj@ktulu:~/code/Homework22$ gcc --version
gcc (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0
```

Note that gcc doesn't have <format> in C++20, which is annoying and means some string manipulation isn't ideal.

### My command line
```
mrj@ktulu:~/code/Homework22$ g++ -std=c++20 hw22.cpp && ./a.out
```
